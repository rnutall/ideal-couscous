#***Cuttin Corner***

Hey Y'all welcome to my project!

 As an entrepreneur first I like to learn. I'm a life learner. So I saw that this was an expense that I could not avoid. Also as I use apps daily I see
 many different things as far as implementation of certain techniques and so forth. So I decided to learn. This is my personal Barber booking app.
 The reason and motivation for me getting into Web-Dev in the first pace, this project I experimented with vite framework.
 as its a popular framework and i just wanted to try it. I implemented a carousel of images to display previous work for potental clients to view,
 with many styles displayed.
